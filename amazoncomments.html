<!--
1.data structure cuz it organises data using array and object

2.Use datastructure to generate HTML instead of writing manually
  * to generate HTML we need to loop through this array
  * forEach = saves each object in product parameter and runs function
  Html for one product from simon's site
  for each product we are creating HTML

3.let productsHTML created to combine all generated html on page
  productHTML = productHTML + the string
  : This is accumulator pattern 

4.first the product.js file so that next script files stores
  data from product.js and then run function to generate HTML
  SCRIPT elements are loaded one by one so order matters
  SO first we save data info in arrays then we generate HTML looping through

5.** AFTER generating html we are targeting add to cart button
  we are looping through the HTML  so for each of the button we are adding 
  event listener

6.Adding on top  it will craete an array representing cart

7.we could have simply done cart.push({productName: 'Basketball',
                                      quantity: 1});
 but it will only add basketball after all add to cart button
 so we are using Data Attribute --it is HTML attribute
 it allows us to attach any info to HTML element
 its name start with data and then we can give it any name we can want
 example product-name kebab case
 we can also attach image or price
 dataset gives us all the data attribute attach to data 
 dataset while fetching dataset.productNmae gets convert to camelCase

8.now we have to push the name and quantity into cart variable which is 
  in the next js file
  we are pushing an object because we wanted to push name and quantity

9.we are looping through the cart to see whether the product name 
  is already there in cart

10.now to update cart quantity icon on screen 
  we are looping through the cart to add all cart quantity
11.variable to store total quantity

12...is to get ouside of current folder
    we have to put all imports at top of file
    in order for mudules to work use live server
13.takes product id and adds it into cart-->
