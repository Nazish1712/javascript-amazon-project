<!--
    1.data structure cuz it organises data using array and object

    2.Use datastructure to generate HTML instead of writing manually
 * to generate HTML we need to loop through this array
 * forEach = saves each object in product parameter and runs function
 Html for one product from simon's site
 for each product we are creating HTML

 3.let productsHTML created to combine all generated html on page
productHTML = productHTML + the string
: This is accumulator pattern -->
