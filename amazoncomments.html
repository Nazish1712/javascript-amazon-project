<!--
    1.data structure cuz it organises data using array and object

    2.Use datastructure to generate HTML instead of writing manually
 * to generate HTML we need to loop through this array
 * forEach = saves each object in product parameter and runs function
 Html for one product from simon's site
 for each product we are creating HTML

 3.let productsHTML created to combine all generated html on page
productHTML = productHTML + the string
: This is accumulator pattern 
4. first the product.js file so that next script files stores
data from product.js and then run function to generate HTML
SCRIPT elements are loaded one by one so order matters
SO first we save data info in arrays then we generate HTML looping through
